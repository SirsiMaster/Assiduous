## üìù NOTES & CONTEXT

### Recent Changes (Oct 4, 2025)
- Fixed carousel overlay issue in "How It Works" section
- Implemented granular cache control headers (HTML: no-cache, JS/CSS: 1 day, Images: 30 days)
- Resolved CI/CD pipeline failures by correcting directory structure
- Ensured all path references use lowercase consistently

### Known Issues
1. Development metrics on dashboard show placeholder data (need real Firebase Analytics integration)
2. Some Dependabot security alerts need addressing (52 vulnerabilities)
3. Build directory duplication causing confusion

### Decisions Log
- **Oct 4:** Decided to use `max-age=0` for HTML files to prevent cache staleness
- **Sep 29:** Standardized all paths to lowercase to prevent case-sensitivity issues
- **Sep 9:** Launched with placeholder data; real backend integration deferred to Phase 5
