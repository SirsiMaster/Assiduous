## üîÑ Data Flow & Integration

### localStorage Schema:
```javascript
// Saved properties (array of property IDs)
localStorage.savedProperties = ["prop-123", "prop-456", ...]

// Recently viewed (array of property IDs, max 10)
localStorage.recentlyViewed = ["prop-789", "prop-123", ...]

// Scheduled viewings (array of viewing objects)
localStorage.scheduledViewings = [
  {
    propertyId: "prop-123",
    property: { /* full property object */ },
    date: "2025-01-10",
    time: "14:00",
    notes: "...",
    createdAt: "2025-01-06T..."
  },
  ...
]

## üìù Notes

### Design Patterns Used:
- **Module Pattern**: ES6 modules with imports
- **Observer Pattern**: localStorage events for cross-tab sync
- **Factory Pattern**: PropertyService for API abstraction
- **Component Pattern**: Reusable property card rendering

### Best Practices Followed:
- ‚úÖ Semantic HTML5
- ‚úÖ CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- ‚úÖ Accessible SVG icons with proper attributes
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation
- ‚úÖ Progressive enhancement
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first responsive design
- ‚úÖ Clean code with comments
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions

### Known Limitations:
- localStorage has 5-10MB limit (sufficient for current use case)
- No cross-device sync (requires backend integration)
- No real-time notifications (requires backend integration)
- Property data mocked via PropertyService (requires real API)
