# Rollback Registry

This document maintains a record of all production releases and their rollback procedures for the Assiduous AI-Powered Real Estate Platform.

## Purpose

The rollback registry provides:
- Quick reference for reverting to previous stable versions
- Historical record of all production deployments
- Standardized rollback procedures
- Risk assessment for version changes

## Rollback Procedures

### Standard Rollback Process

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Identify the issue requiring rollback
   - Document the problem for post-mortem
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Pre-Rollback Checks**
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   git describe --tags --always
   
   # Check for uncommitted changes
   git status
   
   # Backup current state
   git stash save "Pre-rollback backup $(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
   ```

3. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Use the rollback script
   ./scripts/rollback/rollback_to_tag.sh <target-version>
   
   # Or manually:
   git checkout tags/v<version>
   ```

4. **Post-Rollback Verification**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check user reports

5. **Documentation**
   - Update this registry
   - Create incident report
   - Schedule post-mortem

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Issue Type | Rollback Decision | Approval Required |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Data corruption | Immediate | On-call Engineer |
| Critical | Security breach | Immediate | Security Team |
| High | Feature breaking | Within 1 hour | Team Lead |
| Medium | Performance degradation | Within 4 hours | Product Owner |
| Low | UI/UX issues | Next maintenance window | Product Owner |

## Emergency Contacts

| Role | Name | Contact | Availability |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| Technical Lead | [TBD] | [TBD] | 24/7 |
| DevOps Lead | [TBD] | [TBD] | 24/7 |
| Product Owner | [TBD] | [TBD] | Business hours |
| Security Team | [TBD] | [TBD] | 24/7 |

## Rollback Scripts

### Available Scripts

1. **create_tag.sh** - Create a new version tag with validation
2. **rollback_to_tag.sh** - Rollback to a specific version
3. **emergency_rollback.sh** - Fast rollback for critical situations

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a new release tag
./scripts/rollback/create_tag.sh 0.2.0 "AI integration release"

# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback/rollback_to_tag.sh v0.1.0

# Emergency rollback (skips checks)
./scripts/rollback/emergency_rollback.sh v0.1.0
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Tag Releases**
   - Use semantic versioning
   - Include detailed release notes
   - Test rollback procedure

2. **Database Considerations**
   - Maintain backward-compatible migrations
   - Test rollback with production data copy
   - Have database backup before major releases

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Version control all configuration
   - Document environment variables
   - Maintain configuration compatibility

4. **Communication**
   - Notify team before rollback
   - Update status page
   - Inform affected users

## Rollback Metrics

Track these metrics for each rollback:

- Time to detect issue
- Time to decision
- Time to execute rollback
- Time to verify success
- Total downtime
- Users affected
- Root cause category
