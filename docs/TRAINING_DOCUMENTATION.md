This file provides mandatory development rules for Claude AI when working with this repository.

**CRITICAL: These rules are synchronized with WARP.md and must remain identical.**

---

## üö® ABSOLUTE DEVELOPMENT RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)

### **RULE 0: CHECK SIRSIMASTER COMPONENT LIBRARY FIRST**
**Before creating ANY UI component, utility, or shared functionality:**
- **ALWAYS** check the SirsiMaster Component Library at `/Users/thekryptodragon/Development/sirsimaster-component-library`
- **USE** existing library components instead of creating new ones
- **REFERENCE** the library's WARP.md for component usage guidelines
- **CONTRIBUTE** new generic components to the library, not this project
- **Library GitHub**: https://github.com/SirsiMaster/sirsimaster-component-library

### **RULE 1: ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING DOCUMENTATION FIRST**
**Before starting ANY task, you MUST:**
- Read and understand ALL existing project documentation
- Verify what functionality already exists and is working
- Check against established project plans and architecture
- Ensure you're not duplicating work or breaking existing functionality
- Review similar implementations that already exist in the project
- **NEVER modify or break existing working files without explicit instruction**
- **NEVER recreate or simplify existing code**
- **ALWAYS build on top of existing UI/content**

### **RULE 2: MANDATORY COMPLETION VERIFICATION**
**Before reporting ANY task as complete, you MUST:**
- Run the completion verification script: `./scripts/verify_completion.sh`
- Test all functionality you claim to have implemented
- Verify that claimed changes actually exist in the files
- Confirm that all components/pages work as specified
- Check that nothing existing was broken by your changes
- **NEVER report completion without running verification**

### **RULE 3: VALIDATE GROUND TRUTH**
**After completing ANY development work, you MUST:**
- Test all implemented functionality against the project requirements
- Update development documentation to reflect current reality
- Ensure analytics and dashboards show accurate current status
- Report the true development status, not assumptions
- Validate that the project state matches what you report
- **The documentation and dashboards must reflect ground truth, always**

### **RULE 4: MANDATORY HARSH QA/QC ASSESSMENT BEFORE COMPLETION CLAIMS**
**Before claiming ANY feature/task is complete, you MUST perform this severe assessment:**

#### **A. Browser-Based End-to-End Testing (CRITICAL)**
1. **NEVER claim completion without actual browser testing**
2. **Open every page in a real browser** (not just HTTP status checks)
3. **Open browser DevTools Console** and check for JavaScript errors
4. **Click through EVERY user flow** from start to finish
5. **Test on mobile device or responsive view**
6. **Verify data actually loads** (not just loading spinners)
7. **Check that all buttons and links work**
8. **Confirm all API calls succeed** (check Network tab)

#### **B. Method/Function Verification**
1. **Verify ALL called methods exist** before using them
2. **Verify ALL imports are correct** and files exist at specified paths
3. **Check ALL event handlers** are properly bound
4. **Validate ALL data transformations** work with real data

#### **C. Complete User Workflow Validation**
For EVERY user role (client, agent, admin), verify:
1. User can access their dashboard - loads without errors
2. User can view list pages - data displays correctly
3. User can view detail pages - all fields populate
4. User can perform CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete all work
5. User can navigate between pages - all links work
6. User workflows are end-to-end complete

#### **D. Critical Self-Assessment Questions**
Before claiming completion, answer these questions HONESTLY:

1. ‚ùì **Did I test this in an actual browser?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
2. ‚ùì **Did I check the browser console for errors?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
3. ‚ùì **Did I click through the entire user workflow?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
4. ‚ùì **Did I verify all methods/functions exist?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
5. ‚ùì **Can a real user actually accomplish the intended task?** - If NO or UNSURE ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
6. ‚ùì **Would this work if deployed to production right now?** - If NO or UNSURE ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
7. ‚ùì **Have I verified backend AND frontend work together?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
8. ‚ùì **Are there any assumptions I haven't verified?** - If YES ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE until verified

#### **E. Completion Criteria Checklist**
A task is ONLY complete when ALL of these are TRUE:

- [ ] ‚úÖ All code written and committed
- [ ] ‚úÖ All files deployed to appropriate environment
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tested in actual browser with DevTools open
- [ ] ‚úÖ Zero JavaScript console errors
- [ ] ‚úÖ All user workflows tested end-to-end
- [ ] ‚úÖ All methods/functions verified to exist
- [ ] ‚úÖ All API calls return expected data
- [ ] ‚úÖ All database operations work correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ All UI elements visible and functional
- [ ] ‚úÖ All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Can confidently demo to stakeholder right now
- [ ] ‚úÖ Would recommend deploying to real users

---

### **RULE 5: MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE (NEVER SKIP)**
**ALL code changes MUST flow through this pipeline. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

#### **A. Pipeline Flow (STRICT ORDER)**
```
DEV ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí GITHUB ‚Üí FIREBASE PRODUCTION
```

**Each stage is a mandatory checkpoint. You CANNOT skip stages.**

#### **B. Environment Specifications**

| Environment | Port | Directory | Purpose | Server URL |
|-------------|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **DEV** | 8081 | `environments/dev/` | Active development, frequent changes | http://localhost:8081 |
| **TEST** | 8082 | `environments/test/` | Testing and validation | http://localhost:8082 |
| **STAGING** | 8083 | `environments/staging/` | Final verification before production | http://localhost:8083 |
| **PROD** | N/A | `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/` | Live production site | https://assiduousflip.web.app |

#### **C. Development Workflow (MANDATORY STEPS)**

**Step 1: DEV Environment**
1. Make ALL changes in `environments/dev/` directory ONLY
2. Start dev server: `./scripts/dev-server.sh start`
3. Test changes at http://localhost:8081
4. Run RULE 4 QA/QC assessment (full browser testing)
5. Fix ALL bugs found
6. Document changes

**Step 2: Promote DEV ‚Üí TEST**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh dev-to-test`
2. Review changes to be promoted
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Test at http://localhost:8082
5. Run RULE 4 QA/QC assessment again
6. Verify no regressions

**Step 3: Promote TEST ‚Üí STAGING**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh test-to-staging`
2. Review changes
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Test at http://localhost:8083
5. Run RULE 4 QA/QC final assessment
6. Verify production-ready

**Step 4: Promote STAGING ‚Üí PROD**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh staging-to-prod`
2. Review changes
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Changes copied to `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/`
5. Commit to GitHub: `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push`

**Step 5: Deploy PROD ‚Üí Firebase**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh deploy`
2. Complete pre-deployment checklist
3. Type `DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION` (exact text)
4. Firebase deploys automatically
5. Verify at https://assiduousflip.web.app
6. Run post-deployment smoke tests

#### **D. Pipeline Rules (ABSOLUTE)**

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Edit files directly in `test/`, `staging/`, or `assiduous-build/`
- ‚ùå Skip environments (DEV ‚Üí PROD is FORBIDDEN)
- ‚ùå Deploy without testing in all environments
- ‚ùå Promote with known bugs
- ‚ùå Deploy without Git commit
- ‚ùå Make changes directly in production
- ‚ùå Bypass approval gates
- ‚ùå Create a `public/` directory (unauthorized architecture change)
- ‚ùå Recreate existing files from scratch
- ‚ùå Simplify or remove existing functionality

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Start in DEV environment
- ‚úÖ Test in each environment before promoting
- ‚úÖ Run QA/QC at each stage
- ‚úÖ Document what changed
- ‚úÖ Get approval before promoting
- ‚úÖ Commit to GitHub before Firebase deploy
- ‚úÖ Verify deployment succeeded
- ‚úÖ Build on existing UI/content/structure
- ‚úÖ Preserve all existing functionality

#### **E. Validation Requirements Per Stage**

**DEV Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles/runs without errors
- ‚úÖ All new features work as expected
- ‚úÖ No console errors in browser DevTools
- ‚úÖ All links and navigation work
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design works
- ‚úÖ Builds on existing structure (no recreations)

**TEST Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ All DEV features still work
- ‚úÖ No regressions in existing features
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing code works
- ‚úÖ API calls succeed
- ‚úÖ Data persists correctly

**STAGING Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready quality
- ‚úÖ All user workflows complete end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable (page load < 3s)
- ‚úÖ No known bugs
- ‚úÖ Ready to show stakeholders

**PROD Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Deployed successfully to Firebase
- ‚úÖ All pages accessible at production URL
- ‚úÖ All functionality works in production
- ‚úÖ No errors in production logs
- ‚úÖ Analytics tracking works

#### **F. Server Management Commands**

```bash
# Start all servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh start

# Check server status
./scripts/dev-server.sh status

# Stop all servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh stop

# Restart servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh restart
```

#### **G. GitHub as Source of Truth**

**CRITICAL: GitHub is the single source of truth**

- All code in `environments/dev/` is work-in-progress
- All code in `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/` is committed to GitHub
- GitHub main branch = what's in production
- Never deploy to Firebase without pushing to GitHub first

**Deployment flow:**
```
DEV ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí assiduous-build ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Firebase
```

## üìã DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

### **When Making Changes:**
1. **Read existing code first** - understand what's already there
2. **Build incrementally** - add to existing structure, don't replace
3. **Preserve existing patterns** - follow established conventions
4. **Test frequently** - don't write large amounts of untested code
5. **Document as you go** - update docs when changing functionality

### **When Creating New Features:**
1. **Check if similar feature exists** - learn from existing implementations
2. **Use existing components** - especially from SirsiMaster Component Library
3. **Follow existing UI patterns** - maintain consistency
4. **Use existing services** - don't duplicate API calls or data handling
5. **Add to existing pages** - don't create parallel structures

### **When Fixing Bugs:**
1. **Understand the root cause** - don't just patch symptoms
2. **Test the fix thoroughly** - ensure it actually resolves the issue
3. **Check for regressions** - make sure fix doesn't break other things
4. **Update tests if applicable** - prevent regression in future
5. **Document the fix** - explain what was wrong and how it's fixed

### **When Working with UI:**
1. **Never use emojis as icons** - use proper SVG icons
2. **Never use inline styles** - use CSS classes and variables
3. **Always use existing CSS variables** - maintain design consistency
4. **Always test mobile responsive** - ensure works on all screen sizes
5. **Always check browser console** - verify no JavaScript errors

---

## üéØ HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY

### **When Reporting Status:**

**NEVER say:**
- ‚ùå "100% complete" without browser testing
- ‚ùå "Everything works" without clicking through workflows
- ‚ùå "Ready for production" without end-to-end testing
- ‚ùå "Feature implemented" if only code is written but not tested

**ALWAYS say:**
- ‚úÖ "Tested in browser, all workflows verified working"
- ‚úÖ "End-to-end testing complete, found and fixed X bugs"
- ‚úÖ "Browser console clean, no JavaScript errors"
- ‚úÖ "Can confidently demo all features to stakeholder"
- ‚úÖ "Ready for production deployment" (only after ALL checks pass)

### **When Issues Are Found:**
1. **Report immediately** - don't hide problems
2. **Assess severity** - critical vs. minor issues
3. **Provide honest timeline** - for fixing issues
4. **Update status** - reflect true completion percentage
5. **Document lessons learned** - prevent repeat issues

---

## üìö REFERENCE

### **Key Documentation Files:**
- `WARP.md` - This file's twin (must stay synchronized)
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PIPELINE.md` - Detailed pipeline documentation
- `docs/AGENT_PORTAL_QA_FAILURE_REPORT.md` - Example of what NOT to do
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project status
- `changelog.md` - Version history

### **Critical Scripts:**
- `./scripts/dev-server.sh` - Server management
- `./scripts/promote.sh` - Environment promotion
- `./scripts/verify_completion.sh` - Completion verification

### **Production URLs:**
- Dev: http://localhost:8081
- Test: http://localhost:8082
- Staging: http://localhost:8083
- Production: https://assiduousflip.web.app

---

## üîÑ RULE SYNCHRONIZATION

**CRITICAL: WARP.md and CLAUDE.md must remain synchronized**

When updating rules:
1. Update BOTH files identically
2. Verify both have same rule numbers
3. Verify both have same content
4. Commit both files together
5. Document what changed in commit message

**If rules differ between files:**
1. Identify which is newer
2. Update older file to match
3. Commit synchronization
4. Add note explaining discrepancy

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL REMINDERS

**Every time you work on this project:**
1. ‚úÖ Read these rules before starting
2. ‚úÖ Work in DEV environment first
3. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly at each stage
4. ‚úÖ Use the promotion scripts
5. ‚úÖ Never skip the pipeline
6. ‚úÖ Run QA/QC before claiming completion
7. ‚úÖ Be honest about status
8. ‚úÖ Build on existing code, never recreate
9. ‚úÖ Commit to GitHub before deploying
10. ‚úÖ Verify production works after deployment

**These rules exist to:**
- Prevent production breaks
- Ensure code quality
- Maintain stakeholder trust
- Create reliable deployments
- Build sustainable development practices

**Follow them without exception.**
