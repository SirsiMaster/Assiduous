## Bottom Line

**Current State**: We have excellent security infrastructure and frontend mockups, but minimal backend functionality.

**Production Ready**: Not even close. We're ~8-12% complete based on blueprint requirements.

**What's Needed**: 4-6 months of focused backend development, data integration, and AI implementation before approaching MVP status.

**Positive Note**: Our security foundation is solid, which means we can build features knowing the infrastructure is secure from day one.
