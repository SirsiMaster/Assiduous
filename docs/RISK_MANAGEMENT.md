## COMPREHENSIVE RISK MATRIX

### Risk Scoring Methodology

**Probability Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Very Low (0-10%)
- 2 = Low (11-30%)
- 3 = Medium (31-50%)
- 4 = High (51-70%)
- 5 = Very High (71-100%)

**Impact Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Negligible (< $1K, < 1 day delay)
- 2 = Minor ($1-5K, 1-3 days delay)
- 3 = Moderate ($5-15K, 1 week delay)
- 4 = Major ($15-50K, 2-4 weeks delay)
- 5 = Catastrophic (> $50K, > 1 month delay)

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**
- 1-5: Low Risk (Green)
- 6-12: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- 13-19: High Risk (Orange)
- 20-25: Critical Risk (Red)
