**Next Scheduled Update:** October 11, 2025

---

## üìù NOTES & CONTEXT

### Recent Changes (Oct 4, 2025)
- Fixed carousel overlay issue in "How It Works" section
- Implemented granular cache control headers (HTML: no-cache, JS/CSS: 1 day, Images: 30 days)
- Resolved CI/CD pipeline failures by correcting directory structure
- Ensured all path references use lowercase consistently

### Known Issues
1. Development metrics on dashboard show placeholder data (need real Firebase Analytics integration)

- Success criteria for each phase
- Firestore schema
- API endpoint specifications

**When to Update**:
- Mark phases complete as they finish
- Update current phase status
- Add new tasks as they're identified
- Track progress on active phase

---

### 4. **CHANGELOG.md** (Version History)
**Location**: `/CHANGELOG.md`  
**Purpose**: Record ALL accomplishments and version increments  
**Contains**:
- Version numbers (semantic versioning)
- Release dates
- Added features
- Changed functionality
- Fixed bugs

## üö´ What NOT to Create

### ‚ùå NEVER Create These:
- "Next Steps" documents
- "Action Plan" documents
- "Implementation Guide" documents (unless required by Technical Blueprint)
- "Completion Summary" documents
- "Assessment Report" documents
- "Status Update" documents
- Duplicate planning documents

### ‚úÖ Instead:
- Update the **10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md** with current phase
- Update the **CHANGELOG.md** with accomplishments
- Add rules to **WARP.md** if needed
- Expand **Technical Blueprint** for new features

---

## üìã Decision Matrix: Where Does This Belong?

| Information Type | Canonical Document |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Development rules and governance | WARP.md |
| New product feature specs | Technical Blueprint |
| Current phase status | 10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md |
| Task breakdown for active phase | 10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md |
| Completed work | CHANGELOG.md |
| Bug fixes | CHANGELOG.md |
| Version increments | CHANGELOG.md |
| Project overview | README.md |
| Quick start | README.md |

---

## üîÑ Update Workflow

### When Completing a Phase:
1. ‚úÖ Mark phase complete in **10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md**
2. ‚úÖ Add entry to **CHANGELOG.md** with version bump
3. ‚úÖ Update **README.md** if major features added
4. ‚úÖ Commit with proper conventional commit message

### When Starting a New Phase:
1. ‚úÖ Review **10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md** for current phase details
2. ‚úÖ Check **WARP.md** for rules and guidelines
3. ‚úÖ Reference **Technical Blueprint** for feature specs

## üîí Commitment

**AI Assistant Pledge**:
> I commit to ONLY using these five canonical documents for all planning, tracking, and documentation. I will NOT create additional planning documents. All status updates, phase tracking, and accomplishment recording will be done in these established documents.

**When in Doubt**:
- Check **10_DAY_MVP_PLAN.md** for current phase
- Check **WARP.md** for rules
- Check **Technical Blueprint** for feature specs
- Update **CHANGELOG.md** when done
- ASK before creating ANY new document
