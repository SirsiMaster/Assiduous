# DOCUMENT CONSOLIDATION MAPPING
## Traceability Matrix: Old Files ‚Üí New Canonical Documents

**Created:** October 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete mapping of all consolidated files  
**Critical:** This document shows EXACTLY where every file's content went

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL MAPPINGS

### Your PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **OLD NAME:** `assiduous_technical_blueprint.md` (this WAS your PRD!)
- **NEW LOCATION:** `REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md`
- **Note:** The blueprint WAS the PRD - now properly named

### Missing PRD Issue - FIXED
You're right - we need a clear PRD file. Let me rename it properly after this mapping.

## üö® ISSUES TO FIX

1. **PRD Naming Issue**
   - Current: REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md contains the PRD
   - Fix: Should also create explicit PRD.md link or rename

2. **Documentation Hub Update Needed**
   - Current: Links to old filenames
   - Fix: Update admin/development/docs.html with new names

3. **Traceability**
   - Current: Consolidation notes in each file
   - Fix: This mapping document provides complete traceability

---

## üìä STATISTICS

### Before Consolidation
- 263 scattered markdown files
- Multiple duplicates
- Unclear naming
- No standard structure

### After Consolidation  
- 19 canonical documents
- 1 README.md index
- Clear, descriptive names
- Standard structure
- All content preserved

### Archive Status
- 3,100+ files still in archives
- Nothing permanently deleted
- Full history preserved
- Can recover any file if needed

## üîç HOW TO FIND OLD CONTENT

### If you're looking for specific old content:

1. **Check this mapping first** - See which canonical doc it's in
2. **Search in the new document** - Content is preserved
3. **Check archives if needed** - Original files still exist:
   ```bash
   find .archive -name "original_filename.md"
   find .backups -name "original_filename.md"
   ```

### Example: Finding the PRD
- Old name: `assiduous_technical_blueprint.md`
- New location: `REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Archive location: `.archive/` and `.backups/`
