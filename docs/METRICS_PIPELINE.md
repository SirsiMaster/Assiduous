# Assiduous Metrics Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Assiduous project uses a **comprehensive automated metrics system** that tracks development progress, code quality, security, and business metrics in real-time. This document explains the unified metrics pipeline and how it works.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Git Commit → Post-Commit Hook → Enhanced Metrics Script → JSON Output → Dashboard Display
     ↓              ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
  Developer    Automatic         Comprehensive          metrics_cache.json   Real-time UI
   Action       Trigger           Analysis                                    Updates
```

## Components

### 1. Git Post-Commit Hook
**Location**: `.git/hooks/post-commit`

**Purpose**: Automatically runs after every git commit to update metrics

**What it does**:
- Triggers in background (non-blocking)
- Runs `scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js`
- Logs output to `/tmp/assiduous-metrics.log`

### 2. Enhanced Metrics Script
**Location**: `scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive metrics calculation from multiple sources

**Metrics Tracked**:

#### Git Metrics
- **Total Commits**: All commits in repository (536 as of Oct 13, 2025)
- **Total Files**: Files tracked by git (542 files)
- **Total Days**: Calendar days since project start (65 days since Aug 10, 2025)
- **Active Days**: Unique days with commits (23 days)
- **Lines Added/Deleted**: Code churn metrics
- **Velocity**: Commits per active day (23.3 commits/day)

#### Time & Cost Tracking
- **Total Hours**: Estimated development time (177 hours)
- **Average Hours/Day**: Hours per active day (7.7 hrs/day)
- **Total Cost**: Development cost at $150/hr ($26,550)
- **Today's Activity**: Hours, commits, cost for current day
- **Weekly Activity**: Hours, commits, cost for last 7 days
- **Monthly Activity**: Hours, commits, cost for last 30 days

#### Feature Completion
- **Authentication**: 100% complete
- **Admin Portal**: 90% complete
- **Agent Portal**: 60% in-progress
- **Client Portal**: 70% in-progress
- **Micro-Flipping**: 0% not-started

- **Documentation**: Coverage percentage, file counts
- **Productivity**: Velocity trend, contributor counts
- **Infrastructure**: Hosting costs, domain costs

### 3. Metrics Output Files

#### Primary: `metrics_cache.json`
**Location**: `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/metrics_cache.json`

**Purpose**: Primary metrics file used by dashboard

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-13T21:12:47.077Z",
  "summary": {
    "health": "Good",
    "score": 46,
    "trend": "increasing",
    "alerts": ["⚠️ Test coverage is very low", "✅ Timeline on track"]
  },
  "project": {
    "totalCommits": 536,
    "totalFiles": 542,
    "totalDays": 65,
    "activeDays": 23,
    "totalHours": "177",
    "totalCost": 26550,
    "velocity": "23.3",
    "completionPercentage": 46
  },
  "today": { "commits": 17, "hours": "5.6", "cost": 842 },
  "thisWeek": { "commits": 141, "hours": "46.5", "cost": 6980 },
  "features": { /* feature status */ },
  "quality": { /* quality metrics */ },
  "security": { /* security metrics */ },
  "recentActivity": [ /* recent commits */ ]
}
```

#### Backup: `metrics_cache_enhanced.json`
**Location**: `metrics_cache_enhanced.json` (project root)

**Purpose**: Backup copy for disaster recovery

### 4. Dashboard Display
**Location**: `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/dashboard.html`

**Purpose**: Real-time visualization of all metrics

**Features**:
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Click-through drill-downs for detailed views
- Visual charts and progress bars
- Recent activity feed
- Smart alerts and recommendations

## Key Differences from Previous System

### Before (api_real_metrics.mjs)
- ❌ Only git-based metrics
- ❌ No feature tracking
- ❌ No quality/security metrics
- ❌ Limited business insights
- ❌ Only totalDays OR activeDays (not both)

### Now (update-metrics-enhanced.js)
- ✅ Comprehensive git + project metrics
- ✅ Full feature completion tracking
- ✅ Code quality and security monitoring
- ✅ Business timeline and readiness
- ✅ Both totalDays AND activeDays tracking
- ✅ Enhanced alerts and recommendations
- ✅ 10x more data points

## Important Metrics Definitions

### Total Days vs Active Days

**Total Days (Calendar Days)**:
- Days since project started (Aug 10, 2025 → Today)
- Includes weekends, holidays, non-working days
- Current: **65 days**

**Active Days (Commit Days)**:
- Unique days where commits were made
- Only days with actual development work
- Current: **23 days**

**Why Both Matter**:
- **Total Days**: Real timeline for launch date calculations
- **Active Days**: Accurate velocity and productivity metrics
- **Dashboard should show**: "65 days since start (23 active days)"

### Velocity Calculation

**Formula**: `Total Commits / Active Days`

**Current**: 536 commits / 23 active days = **23.3 commits/day**

**Not**: Total Commits / Total Days (which would be 8.2 commits/day, artificially low)

### Hours Calculation

**Formula**: `Total Commits × 0.33 hours/commit`

**Current**: 536 commits × 0.33 = **177 hours**

**Average per Active Day**: 177 hours / 23 days = **7.7 hours/day**

**Not**: 177 hours / 65 days = 2.7 hours/day (artificially low)

## Automation Flow

### Every Commit
1. Developer runs `git commit`
2. Git post-commit hook triggers
3. Enhanced metrics script runs in background
4. Metrics JSON files updated
5. Dashboard auto-refreshes (if open)

### Manual Trigger
```bash
# From project root
node scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js

# Output shows comprehensive summary
# Files updated automatically
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check last update time
cat firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/metrics_cache.json | jq '.lastUpdated'

# View key metrics
cat firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/metrics_cache.json | jq '.project | {totalCommits, totalDays, activeDays, totalHours, totalCost}'

# Check git hook log
cat /tmp/assiduous-metrics.log
```

## Dashboard Integration

The dashboard loads metrics from `metrics_cache.json` via fetch:

```javascript
async function loadMetrics() {
    const response = await fetch('/admin/development/metrics_cache.json');
    const metrics = await response.json();
    updateDashboardMetrics(metrics);
}
```

**Refresh Strategy**:
- Initial load on page open
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh button available
- Fallback to Firebase if file unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Metrics Not Updating

**Check Git Hook**:
```bash
ls -la .git/hooks/post-commit
cat .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Run Manually**:
```bash
node scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js
```

**Check Logs**:
```bash
cat /tmp/assiduous-metrics.log
```

### Dashboard Shows Old Data

**Force Refresh**:
- Hard reload: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Clear cache and reload
- Close and reopen browser

**Verify File Updated**:
```bash
ls -lah firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/metrics_cache.json
cat firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/admin/development/metrics_cache.json | jq '.lastUpdated'
```

### Wrong Metrics Values

**Recalculate from Scratch**:
```bash
cd /Users/thekryptodragon/Development/assiduous
node scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js
```

**Check Git History**:
```bash
git log --oneline | wc -l  # Should match totalCommits
git log --format=%ad --date=short | sort -u | wc -l  # Should match activeDays
```
