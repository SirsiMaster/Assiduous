# Deployment Summary â€” 2025-09-10

Environment: Production (Firebase Hosting)
Site: https://assiduousflip.web.app

Summary
- Finalized landing page hero with continuous single-layer background rotation (resumes after tab visibility changes)
- Bottom-centered glass stats overlay (4 equal columns; single-line labels; aligned baselines)
- Desktop hero height capped using svh clamp to prevent uncontrolled growth while zooming
- "How It Works" background carousel constrained to its section wrapper (no bleed into hero)
- Multiple refinement passes for alignment, spacing, and professional polish

Verification
- Visual QA performed on desktop (Chrome, Safari), mobile (responsive tools)
- Hard refresh verified production HTML contains:
  - .stats-bar bottom anchor, balanced grid
  - Single-layer rotator script block with visibilitychange handler
  - Hero height clamp rules

Next Steps
- Monitor analytics for engagement impact on hero + stats
- Tune overlay opacity/blur and typography if conversion testing indicates
- Consider adding manual carousel controls (prev/next) as an enhancement
