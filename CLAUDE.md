# CLAUDE.md

This file provides mandatory development rules for Claude AI when working with this repository.

**CRITICAL: These rules are synchronized with WARP.md and must remain identical.**

---

## üö® ABSOLUTE DEVELOPMENT RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)

### **RULE 0: CHECK SIRSIMASTER COMPONENT LIBRARY FIRST**
**Before creating ANY UI component, utility, or shared functionality:**
- **ALWAYS** check the SirsiMaster Component Library at `/Users/thekryptodragon/Development/sirsimaster-component-library`
- **USE** existing library components instead of creating new ones
- **REFERENCE** the library's WARP.md for component usage guidelines
- **CONTRIBUTE** new generic components to the library, not this project
- **Library GitHub**: https://github.com/SirsiMaster/sirsimaster-component-library

### **RULE 1: ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING DOCUMENTATION FIRST**
**Before starting ANY task, you MUST:**
- Read and understand ALL existing project documentation
- Verify what functionality already exists and is working
- Check against established project plans and architecture
- Ensure you're not duplicating work or breaking existing functionality
- Review similar implementations that already exist in the project
- **NEVER modify or break existing working files without explicit instruction**
- **NEVER recreate or simplify existing code**
- **ALWAYS build on top of existing UI/content**

### **RULE 2: MANDATORY COMPLETION VERIFICATION**
**Before reporting ANY task as complete, you MUST:**
- Run the completion verification script: `./scripts/verify_completion.sh`
- Test all functionality you claim to have implemented
- Verify that claimed changes actually exist in the files
- Confirm that all components/pages work as specified
- Check that nothing existing was broken by your changes
- **NEVER report completion without running verification**

### **RULE 3: VALIDATE GROUND TRUTH**
**After completing ANY development work, you MUST:**
- Test all implemented functionality against the project requirements
- Update development documentation to reflect current reality
- Ensure analytics and dashboards show accurate current status
- Report the true development status, not assumptions
- Validate that the project state matches what you report
- **The documentation and dashboards must reflect ground truth, always**

### **RULE 4: MANDATORY HARSH QA/QC ASSESSMENT BEFORE COMPLETION CLAIMS**
**Before claiming ANY feature/task is complete, you MUST perform this severe assessment:**

#### **A. Browser-Based End-to-End Testing (CRITICAL)**
1. **NEVER claim completion without actual browser testing**
2. **Open every page in a real browser** (not just HTTP status checks)
3. **Open browser DevTools Console** and check for JavaScript errors
4. **Click through EVERY user flow** from start to finish
5. **Test on mobile device or responsive view**
6. **Verify data actually loads** (not just loading spinners)
7. **Check that all buttons and links work**
8. **Confirm all API calls succeed** (check Network tab)

#### **B. Method/Function Verification**
1. **Verify ALL called methods exist** before using them
2. **Verify ALL imports are correct** and files exist at specified paths
3. **Check ALL event handlers** are properly bound
4. **Validate ALL data transformations** work with real data

#### **C. Complete User Workflow Validation**
For EVERY user role (client, agent, admin), verify:
1. User can access their dashboard - loads without errors
2. User can view list pages - data displays correctly
3. User can view detail pages - all fields populate
4. User can perform CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete all work
5. User can navigate between pages - all links work
6. User workflows are end-to-end complete

#### **D. Critical Self-Assessment Questions**
Before claiming completion, answer these questions HONESTLY:

1. ‚ùì **Did I test this in an actual browser?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
2. ‚ùì **Did I check the browser console for errors?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
3. ‚ùì **Did I click through the entire user workflow?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
4. ‚ùì **Did I verify all methods/functions exist?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
5. ‚ùì **Can a real user actually accomplish the intended task?** - If NO or UNSURE ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
6. ‚ùì **Would this work if deployed to production right now?** - If NO or UNSURE ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
7. ‚ùì **Have I verified backend AND frontend work together?** - If NO ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE
8. ‚ùì **Are there any assumptions I haven't verified?** - If YES ‚Üí NOT COMPLETE until verified

#### **E. Completion Criteria Checklist**
A task is ONLY complete when ALL of these are TRUE:

- [ ] ‚úÖ All code written and committed
- [ ] ‚úÖ All files deployed to appropriate environment
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tested in actual browser with DevTools open
- [ ] ‚úÖ Zero JavaScript console errors
- [ ] ‚úÖ All user workflows tested end-to-end
- [ ] ‚úÖ All methods/functions verified to exist
- [ ] ‚úÖ All API calls return expected data
- [ ] ‚úÖ All database operations work correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ All UI elements visible and functional
- [ ] ‚úÖ All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Can confidently demo to stakeholder right now
- [ ] ‚úÖ Would recommend deploying to real users

### **RULE 5: MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE (NEVER SKIP)**
**ALL code changes MUST flow through this pipeline. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

#### **A. Pipeline Flow (STRICT ORDER)**
```
DEV ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí GITHUB ‚Üí FIREBASE PRODUCTION
```

**Each stage is a mandatory checkpoint. You CANNOT skip stages.**

#### **B. Environment Specifications**

| Environment | Port | Directory | Purpose | Server URL |
|-------------|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **DEV** | 8081 | `environments/dev/` | Active development, frequent changes | http://localhost:8081 |
| **TEST** | 8082 | `environments/test/` | Testing and validation | http://localhost:8082 |
| **STAGING** | 8083 | `environments/staging/` | Final verification before production | http://localhost:8083 |
| **PROD** | N/A | `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/` | Live production site | https://assiduousflip.web.app |

#### **C. Development Workflow (MANDATORY STEPS)**

**Step 1: DEV Environment**
1. Make ALL changes in `environments/dev/` directory ONLY
2. Start dev server: `./scripts/dev-server.sh start`
3. Test changes at http://localhost:8081
4. Run RULE 4 QA/QC assessment (full browser testing)
5. Fix ALL bugs found
6. Document changes

**Step 2: Promote DEV ‚Üí TEST**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh dev-to-test`
2. Review changes to be promoted
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Test at http://localhost:8082
5. Run RULE 4 QA/QC assessment again
6. Verify no regressions

**Step 3: Promote TEST ‚Üí STAGING**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh test-to-staging`
2. Review changes
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Test at http://localhost:8083
5. Run RULE 4 QA/QC final assessment
6. Verify production-ready

**Step 4: Promote STAGING ‚Üí PROD**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh staging-to-prod`
2. Review changes
3. Type `yes` to confirm
4. Changes copied to `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/`
5. Commit to GitHub: `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push`

**Step 5: Deploy PROD ‚Üí Firebase**
1. Run: `./scripts/promote.sh deploy`
2. Complete pre-deployment checklist
3. Type `DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION` (exact text)
4. Firebase deploys automatically
5. Verify at https://assiduousflip.web.app
6. Run post-deployment smoke tests

#### **D. Pipeline Rules (ABSOLUTE)**

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Edit files directly in `test/`, `staging/`, or `assiduous-build/`
- ‚ùå Skip environments (DEV ‚Üí PROD is FORBIDDEN)
- ‚ùå Deploy without testing in all environments
- ‚ùå Promote with known bugs
- ‚ùå Deploy without Git commit
- ‚ùå Make changes directly in production
- ‚ùå Bypass approval gates
- ‚ùå Create a `public/` directory (unauthorized architecture change)
- ‚ùå Recreate existing files from scratch
- ‚ùå Simplify or remove existing functionality

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Start in DEV environment
- ‚úÖ Test in each environment before promoting
- ‚úÖ Run QA/QC at each stage
- ‚úÖ Document what changed
- ‚úÖ Get approval before promoting
- ‚úÖ Commit to GitHub before Firebase deploy
- ‚úÖ Verify deployment succeeded
- ‚úÖ Build on existing UI/content/structure
- ‚úÖ Preserve all existing functionality

#### **E. Validation Requirements Per Stage**

**DEV Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles/runs without errors
- ‚úÖ All new features work as expected
- ‚úÖ No console errors in browser DevTools
- ‚úÖ All links and navigation work
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design works
- ‚úÖ Builds on existing structure (no recreations)

**TEST Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ All DEV features still work
- ‚úÖ No regressions in existing features
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing code works
- ‚úÖ API calls succeed
- ‚úÖ Data persists correctly

**STAGING Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready quality
- ‚úÖ All user workflows complete end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable (page load < 3s)
- ‚úÖ No known bugs
- ‚úÖ Ready to show stakeholders

**PROD Stage Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Deployed successfully to Firebase
- ‚úÖ All pages accessible at production URL
- ‚úÖ All functionality works in production
- ‚úÖ No errors in production logs
- ‚úÖ Analytics tracking works

#### **F. Server Management Commands**

```bash
# Start all servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh start

# Check server status
./scripts/dev-server.sh status

# Stop all servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh stop

# Restart servers
./scripts/dev-server.sh restart
```

#### **G. GitHub as Source of Truth**

**CRITICAL: GitHub is the single source of truth**

- All code in `environments/dev/` is work-in-progress
- All code in `firebase-migration-package/assiduous-build/` is committed to GitHub
- GitHub main branch = what's in production
- Never deploy to Firebase without pushing to GitHub first

**Deployment flow:**
```
DEV ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí assiduous-build ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Firebase
```

## üìã DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

### **When Making Changes:**
1. **Read existing code first** - understand what's already there
2. **Build incrementally** - add to existing structure, don't replace
3. **Preserve existing patterns** - follow established conventions
4. **Test frequently** - don't write large amounts of untested code
5. **Document as you go** - update docs when changing functionality

### **When Creating New Features:**
1. **Check if similar feature exists** - learn from existing implementations
2. **Use existing components** - especially from SirsiMaster Component Library
3. **Follow existing UI patterns** - maintain consistency
4. **Use existing services** - don't duplicate API calls or data handling
5. **Add to existing pages** - don't create parallel structures

### **When Fixing Bugs:**
1. **Understand the root cause** - don't just patch symptoms
2. **Test the fix thoroughly** - ensure it actually resolves the issue
3. **Check for regressions** - make sure fix doesn't break other things
4. **Update tests if applicable** - prevent regression in future
5. **Document the fix** - explain what was wrong and how it's fixed

### **When Working with UI:**
1. **Never use emojis as icons** - use proper SVG icons
2. **Never use inline styles** - use CSS classes and variables
3. **Always use existing CSS variables** - maintain design consistency
4. **Always test mobile responsive** - ensure works on all screen sizes
5. **Always check browser console** - verify no JavaScript errors

---

## üéØ HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY

### **When Reporting Status:**

**NEVER say:**
- ‚ùå "100% complete" without browser testing
- ‚ùå "Everything works" without clicking through workflows
- ‚ùå "Ready for production" without end-to-end testing
- ‚ùå "Feature implemented" if only code is written but not tested

**ALWAYS say:**
- ‚úÖ "Tested in browser, all workflows verified working"
- ‚úÖ "End-to-end testing complete, found and fixed X bugs"
- ‚úÖ "Browser console clean, no JavaScript errors"
- ‚úÖ "Can confidently demo all features to stakeholder"
- ‚úÖ "Ready for production deployment" (only after ALL checks pass)

### **When Issues Are Found:**
1. **Report immediately** - don't hide problems
2. **Assess severity** - critical vs. minor issues
3. **Provide honest timeline** - for fixing issues
4. **Update status** - reflect true completion percentage
5. **Document lessons learned** - prevent repeat issues
