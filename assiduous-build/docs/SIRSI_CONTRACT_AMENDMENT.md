## SCOPE ADJUSTMENT OVERVIEW

During initial development phases, three critical discoveries emerged that transform this platform from a basic automation tool into a comprehensive real estate transaction powerhouse:

**The Enhanced Challenge:** 
1. **No MLS Access:** Without broker licensing, we need sophisticated multi-source data coordination across PropStream, Zillow, FSBO sites, and public records
2. **Cash Buyer Verification Gap:** Your deals depend on quick cash closings, but you lack systems to verify buyer financial capacity before wasting time
3. **Title Company Bottlenecks:** Manual title ordering and coordination slows your 7-14 day closing target

**Scope Adjustments Required:**
- **Firebase-Native CRM:** Replaces HubSpot
- **Cash Buyer Verification Engine:** Financial validation system
- **Title Company Integration Hub:** Automated title processing
- **Multi-Source Data Coordination:** PropStream, Zillow, FSBO, public records
