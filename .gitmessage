# feat(api): add property valuation endpoint
#
# Added new POST endpoint /api/v1/valuations that accepts property
# address and returns AI-generated valuation estimate. This endpoint
# integrates with our XGBoost model for price prediction.
#
# The endpoint includes rate limiting (100 requests/hour) and requires
# authentication via JWT token.

# Closes #234
