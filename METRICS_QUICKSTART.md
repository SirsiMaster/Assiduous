# Metrics Quick Reference

## ðŸš€ Most Common Commands

```bash
# Deploy updated metrics to Firebase (use this most often)
./scripts/deploy-metrics-to-firebase.sh deploy

# Check current metrics (no deployment)
./scripts/deploy-metrics-to-firebase.sh

# Update metrics manually
node scripts/update-metrics-enhanced.js

# View dashboard
open https://assiduous-prod.web.app/admin/development/dashboard.html
```

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

**Automatic**: Metrics update after every commit (git hook)  
**Manual**: Run deploy script when you want to update live dashboard  
**Optional**: Set up auto-deploy (see guide)
