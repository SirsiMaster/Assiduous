## Customization Options

### To Add a GitHub Token (Optional - for higher API limits):

Edit line 673 in `ceo-dashboard.html`:
```javascript
const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_personal_access_token_here';
```

This increases API calls from 60/hour to 5000/hour.

### To Update the Repository Details:

Edit lines 671-672:
```javascript
const GITHUB_OWNER = 'SirsiMaster';
const GITHUB_REPO = 'Assiduous';
```

### To Modify Progress Calculations:

The progress algorithm is in the `updateProjectProgress()` function (lines 854-875).
Current formula:
- Phase 2: Gains 5% per commit after the 10th commit
- Phase 3: Starts after 30 commits, gains 3% per commit

### To Add Real Updates:

Replace the simulated updates in `loadUpdates()` function (lines 934-957) with a real data source like:
- Firebase Realtime Database
- AWS DynamoDB
- Any REST API endpoint

## Security & Privacy

### Privacy Features:
1. **No SEO Indexing**: 
   ```html
   <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
   <meta name="googlebot" content="noindex, nofollow">
   ```

2. **Private Badge**: Visual indicator on the right side

3. **No External Links**: Dashboard is not linked from main site

4. **Secure API Calls**: Uses HTTPS for all GitHub API requests

### Additional Security (Optional):

For enhanced security, you could add:

1. **Basic Authentication**: Using Netlify Identity or similar
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Through CloudFlare or similar CDN
3. **Custom Subdomain**: Deploy to a separate, unlisted subdomain

## Mobile Responsiveness

The dashboard is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop (1400px+ optimal)
- Tablet (768px - 1399px)
- Mobile (320px - 767px)

Cards stack vertically on mobile devices for easy scrolling.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading:
1. Check if GitHub Pages is enabled
2. Verify the URL is correct (case-sensitive)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Commits Not Showing:
1. Ensure repository is public OR add GitHub token
2. Check repository name and owner are correct
3. API rate limit may be exceeded (60 requests/hour without token)

### Progress Not Updating:
1. Click "Refresh" button manually
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if commits are being pushed to main branch

## Performance Notes

- **Auto-refresh**: Every 5 minutes for commits
- **Chart Updates**: Real-time as new data loads
- **Caching**: Browser caches static resources
- **API Limits**: 60 requests/hour (unauthenticated)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions you might consider:

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time commit notifications
2. **Milestone Tracking**: Connect to GitHub Milestones
3. **Issue/PR Metrics**: Show open issues and pull requests
4. **Deployment Status**: Show production deployment status
5. **Financial Metrics**: Integrate with accounting systems
6. **Team Activity**: Show contributor statistics
7. **Custom Alerts**: Email/SMS for specific events

## Support

If you need to modify the dashboard:
1. Edit `/docs/ceo-dashboard.html`
2. Commit changes to main branch
3. GitHub Pages will auto-deploy within minutes

The dashboard uses only CDN-hosted libraries (Chart.js) so no build process is required.
